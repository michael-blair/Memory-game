Memory game brainstorming:
Flipping over cards then matching images 
Progressively gets more cards in the array 
Computer flips random cards, then user must click them 
Progressively gets faster flips 
More cards flipped at once
Ball hidden under 1 cup game 
Harder with more cups	
Various levels or difficulties for the user to select
The use of GUI to enhance presentation of the game
The incorporation of math equations for higher difficulty 
Re-typing a sentence typed on the screen
Sentences get longer/ more difficult
Re-typing numbers on the screen 
Numbers get longer

Additional ideas:
Read and write to a text file to save high scores 

Pseudocode for Computer flips random cards, then user must click them
Set array of cards to 4x4 with different colours on each side, and a GO button 
Give each card a corresponding number between 0-15 
Randomly generate 3 numbers between 0-15
Flip the corresponding cards and leave on screen for 1.5 seconds 
Get user to click on the cards that were flipped over, and click GO when done
Check if user got correct
If correct: user gets 1 point (or more depending on difficulty)
	User moves on to next level
If incorrect: end game 

Ways to make more difficult:
More cards in the array 
More cards flipped (generate more random numbers) 
Flip the cards for a shorter period of times 

Pseudocode for Re-typing numbers on the screen 
Set 1 text box, 1 text label, and 1 GO button on the screen
Randomly generate a string of digits to the text label 
Flash the digits on the screen for 1 second 
Have the user type try to type in the correct number, then press GO
If correct: user gets points depending on difficulty 
User moves onto next level 
If incorrect: game ends 

Ways to make more difficult:
Have a longer string of digits for the user to guess
